# Welcome!

"Move It All" is an attempt to bring as many resources, questions, best practices, tips, and tricks about the Move language into one place. Please contribute to it or suggest a change in the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/jaredcosulich/move_it_all/discussions)

The primary sections are [Questions](questions.md) and [Best Practices](best-practices.md) where we are gathering as many questions and best practices as we can find but we've also included links to other resources for convenience.


This is meant to be a public good so please focus on adding value where ever possible.
